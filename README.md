# NMEA-GPGGA-Message-Processor
This project processes NMEA GPGGA messages from a text file. It extracts and validates critical data such as time, latitude, longitude, and satellite count from each GPGGA message. The program reads the input from a file named "nmea_messages.txt" and outputs the extracted information to the console
